If the user has the beginner-friendly Arduino WiFi Rev2 microcontroller in addition to the ESP32 required, it is recommended to start with `PM25Bluetooth`. This will teach them how to integrate the Plantower PMS5003 into an Arduino circuit and the basics of Bluetooth Low Energy; BLE is easier to set up using this board than it is with the ESP32. It will also allow the user to understand how accurate the measurements reported by the Plantower are, if they can compare the measurements returned to those of another data source.
